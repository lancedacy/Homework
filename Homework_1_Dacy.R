# 1a The log of a positive number.
log(5)

# 1b What is the default base for the log function? 10
# Calculate the log of your previous number with a different base.
# Defautl base is 10
log2(5)

#1c The log of a negative number. (explain the answer)
#log(-5)

#1d The square-root of a positive number.
sqrt(5)

# 2a Create a vector of 15 standard normal random variables. Calculate its mean and
# SD (Standard Deviation).
x = rnorm(15)
x
mean(x)
sd(x)

# 2b Change the mean to 10 and the SD to 2 and recalculate the vector of 
# 15 random normal variables. Calculate its mean and SD.
SDs specified in the function?
x = rnorm(15, mean = 10, sd = 2)
x
mean(x)
sd(x)

#2c. Why are the means and SD not exactly the same as the means and SD specified in the function?
# because they are reandom generated sets
